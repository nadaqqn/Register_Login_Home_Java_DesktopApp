# Register_Login_Home_Java_DesktopApp
Java Desktop Application consist Register page, Login page, and Home page

I made a project using Java programming language to create a desktop application with three main pages: Register, Login, and Home. The Register page allows users to register an account by entering their name, username, password, and re-typing the password. After registering, users are directed to the Login page, where they can enter their username and password to log in. Upon successful login, users are greeted with a welcome message on the Home page, which also displays their name. This project provides a simple yet functional user authentication system, demonstrating basic concepts of Java programming and GUI development.
